Paragraph formatting has been adapted from Westcott and Hort, 1881.

### Additional Text

Words not contained in the Nestle text have been included with the following notation:

Only the last version from left to right to contain a given variant is noted.

The Nestle text itself has been marked if not contained in either NA or SBL texts.

TR and RP are included for major variants not contained in the critical texts.

### Variants

Where both the NA and SBL agree on a variant word or spelling, it replaces the Nestle along with the following notation:

`**` Major variant `*` Minor or spelling variant

The above notation is also used in a few cases such as John 8 where NA and WH agree and SBL does not include the text.

### Word order Variants

Where either NA or SBL render the word order differently, the NE order is maintained, with the variant noted as follows:

«NE Text» ⇔ «NA and / or SBL text»
